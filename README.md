# FCC_Rock_Paper_Scissor
As a part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python curriculam, this projected was developed based on the Markov Chain. Amongst the five projects in this Machine Learning course, I found this project the toughest of all. After many attempts, I was still unable to defeat Abby. By some research and reading article, I found Sri Hartini's report on "Rock Paper Scissor in Python' very helpful for me.

Here is detailed information about this project provided by freeCodeCamp:
